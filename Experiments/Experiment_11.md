# Experiment - 11: Explore Data Visualization libraries in Python and R

## Lab Outcomes (LO):
- Implement visualization techniques to given data sets using R. (LO5)
- Implement visualization techniques to given data sets using Python. (LO6)

## Task to be performed :
1. Explore Top-5 Data Visualization Libraries in Python (w.r.t Features & Applications)
2. Explore Top-5 Data Visualization Libraries in R (w.r.t Features & Applications)
3. Install 2 Libraries each for Python and R
4. Perform simple experiments on the 2 identified libraries each for Python and R
5. Prepare a document with the Aim, Tasks performed, Program, Output, and Conclusion.

## Tools & Libraries to be explored
* Python Libraries : Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotnine(ggplot), Bokeh, pygal, Plotly, geoplotlib, Gleam, missingno, Leather, Altair, Folium
* R Libararies : ggplot2, Lattice, highcharter, Leaflet, RColorBrewer, Plotly, sunburstR, RGL, dygraphs

## Outcome :
* Identified the Data Visualziation Libraries in Python and R
* Performed simple experiments with these libraries in Python and R
