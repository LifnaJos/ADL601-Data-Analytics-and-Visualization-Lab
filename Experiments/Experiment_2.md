# Experiment - 2: Simple Linear Regression in Python and R
## Lab Outcomes (LO):
* Implement various Regression techniques for prediction. (LO2)
## Task to be performed :
1. List the packages to be used for Simple Linear Regression in Python
2. Download the dataset from UCI Repository / Kaggle
   - Load data into Google Colab
   - Display the summary of the dataset
3. Check whether the data meets the assumptions
   - Normality : Check whether the dependent variable follows a normal distribution
   - Lineartiy : Check the relationship between the independent and dependent variable
5. Perform Linear Regression Analysis using the identified package
6. Visualize the results with a graph
   - Draw the Simple Linear Regression line to the plotted data
   - Add the equation for the Regression Line on the graph
8. Repeat the steps 2 to 5 using R libraries
9. Prepare a Colab Notebook with the Aim, Tasks performed, Program, Output, and Conclusion and upload the Notebook in your Github Repositiry.
10. Prepare a handwritten wrtieup with Aim, Theory and Conclusion.

## Tools & Libraries to be explored
* Python Libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas
* R Libraries: lm, ggplot2, dplyr, broom, ggubr

## Theory to be written:
1. Why do we need to study Multiple Linear Regression?
2. Write the equation for Multiple Linear Regression.
3. **Solve** : The following measurements have been obtained in a study. It is expected that the response variable y be described by the independent variables x1 and x2. Calculate the parameter estimates bo, b1 and b2.
