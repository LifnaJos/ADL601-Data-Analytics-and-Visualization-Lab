# Experiment - 3: Multiple Linear Regression in Python and R
## Lab Outcomes (LO):
* Implement various Regression techniques for prediction. (LO2)
## Task to be performed :
1. List the packages to be used for Multiple Linear Regression in Python
2. Download the dataset from UCI Repository / Kaggle

   -- Load data into Google Colab

   -- Display the summary of the dataset
3. Create a model and fit it
4. Get the values : Coefficient of Determination, Intercept and Coefficients
5. Predict the response
6. Visualize the results with a graph
7. Repeat the steps 2 to 6 using R libraries
8. Prepare a Colab Notebook with the Aim, Tasks performed, Program, Output, and Conclusion and upload the Notebook in your Github Repositiry.
9. Prepare a handwritten wrtieup with Aim, Theory and Conclusion.

## Tools & Libraries to be explored
* Python Libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas
* R Libraries: lm, ggplot2, dplyr, broom, ggubr

## Theory to be written:
1. Why do we need to study Multiple Linear Regression?
2. Write the equation for Multiple Linear Regression.
3. **Solve** : The following measurements have been obtained in a study. It is expected that the response variable y be described by the independent variables x1 and x2. Calculate the parameter estimates bo, b1 and b2.
