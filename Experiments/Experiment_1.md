# Experiment - 1: Getting introduced to data analytics libraries in Python and R

* Lab Outcomes (LO): Explore various data analytics Libraries in R and Python. (LO1)

## Task to be performed :
1. Explore Top-5 Data Analytics Libraries in Python (w.r.t Features & Applications)
2. Explore Top-5 Data Analytics Libraries in R (w.r.t Features & Applications)
3. Install 2 Libraries each for Python and R
4. Perform simple experiments on the 2 identified libraries each for Python and R
5. Prepare a document with the Aim, Tasks performed, Program, Output, and Conclusion.
